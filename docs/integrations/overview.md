# Building AI Agents with MCPHub

MCPHub acts as your MCP server, exposing your APIs as tools that AI frameworks and applications can discover and use. This page guides you through integrating MCPHub with various AI agent platforms.

## How It Works

1. **Deploy your APIs** to MCPHub as MCP configurations
2. **Get your MCP URL**: `http://your-mcphub-host/tenantId/mcpName/mcp`
3. **Connect AI frameworks** to your MCPHub MCP endpoint
4. **Build AI agents** that can call your APIs through natural language
